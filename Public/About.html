        <p>Hi, i am 20 years old and was born in Sweden on the 24th of october 2003. </br>
           I have been living in Stockholm my whole life in a small part called Kallh√§ll.</br>
           Ever since i was little i was very interested in computer games and my first console was </br>
           The playstation 2, where i played loads of different games. It is only until recently i have </br>
           started learning how to code but i do think it alings well with my already attained </br>
           excperience.
